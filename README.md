Thank you for trying out the You Have To Win The Game randomizer!
This is version 1.1
This was created by ZZKylie / ZZKer

Version features:
 1.1:
  -  Special map edit designed for Randomizer to prevent softlocks.
 1.0:
  -  Orb randomization.
  -  Seeded random.
  -  BUG: Some seeds lead to softlocks if orbs are done in the wrong order. To avoid this, always go right at the beginning.

Needed files:
 -  Python 3.8.1 to run program (earlier versions of Python 3 might work. 3.7.3 confirmed to work):
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
 -  You Have to Win the Game example map:
   http://www.piratehearts.com/files/YHtWtG_Campaign.zip

Install:
 -  Make sure Python is installed
 -  Unzip YHtWtG_Campaign.zip into C:\Users\[your user name]\Documents\my games\You Have to Win the Game\Maps
 -  Place RandomizeYHTWTGv1_1.py and randomBase.map into the same folder
 -  That's it! :D

To Run:
 -  Just double click the .py file and enter a seed number. The new map will appear in your map list in-game.

The Future:
 -  treasure/orb inter-randomization
 -  teleporter randomization
 -  room randomization
 -  maybe even bell and enemy randomization
