-Version features-

1.2:
 -  Orbs are now randomized with most treasures (66/70 locations)
 -  Special map edit to prevent hardlocks, but not all possible softlocks ;)

1.1:
 -  Special map edit designed for Randomizer to prevent softlocks.

1.0:
 -  Orb randomization.
 -  Seeded random.
 -  BUG: Some seeds lead to softlocks if orbs are done in the wrong order. To avoid this, always go right at the beginning.

Needed files:
 -  Python 3.8.1 to run program (earlier versions of Python 3 might work. 3.7.3 confirmed to work):
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
 -  You Have to Win the Game example map:
   http://www.piratehearts.com/files/YHtWtG_Campaign.zip
 -  You Have to Win the Game on Steam (available for free)

Install:
 -  Make sure Python is installed
 -  Make sure You Have to Win the Game on Steam is installed and played at least once (to initialize folders)
 -  Unzip YHtWtG_Campaign.zip into C:\Users\[your user name]\Documents\my games\You Have to Win the Game\Maps
 -  Place RandomizeYHTWTG.py, randomBase.map, & Rooms_randomBase.xml into the same folder as above
 -  That's it! :D

To Run:
 -  Just double click the .py file and enter a seed number. The new map will appear in your map list in-game.

The Future:
 -  teleporter randomization
 -  room randomization
 -  start randomization
 -  magic word randomization?
 -  maybe even bell and enemy randomization
 -  Hardmode and glitch logic options
